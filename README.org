A collection of KDE resources and repos exposed as a Repo manifest for all your
grep-finding pleasure.

* KDE Invent

[[https://invent.kde.org/explore/groups?sort=name_asc][Invent.kde.org]] is the main forge for KDE. It's split into the following groups, which we can pull with their [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/][Gitlab API]], via org-babel and either restclient or graphql.

Assuming that the presence of Gitlab [[https://invent.kde.org/help/api/graphql/index.md][GraphQL docs]] in [[https://invent.kde.org/help/#build-an-integration-with-gitlab][KDE's integration docs]]
implies that feature is active, that would be far more convenient. Checking the
Gitlab [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/index.html][GraphQL docs]] (including the [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/getting_started.html][Getting Started]] guide) gives us some more
info.
