* KDE Invent

[[https://invent.kde.org/explore/groups?sort=name_asc][Invent.kde.org]] is the main forge for KDE. It's split into the following groups, which we can pull with their [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/][Gitlab API]], via org-babel and either restclient or graphql.

Assuming that the presence of Gitlab [[https://invent.kde.org/help/api/graphql/index.md][GraphQL docs]] in [[https://invent.kde.org/help/#build-an-integration-with-gitlab][KDE's integration docs]]
implies that feature is active, that would be far more convenient. Checking the
Gitlab [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/index.html][GraphQL docs]] (including the [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/getting_started.html][Getting Started]] guide) gives us some more
info.


** Schema

This can run in the GraphiQL explorer

#+begin_src graphql
query {
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
      fields { name }
    }
  }
}
#+end_src


** Groups

#+name: invent-groups-graphql
#+begin_example graphql
query {
  groups(first: 100)  {
    nodes {
      id
      name
      parent {
        id
        name
        path
        fullPath
      }
      description
      path
      fullPath
      projects {
        count
      }
    }
	}
}
#+end_example

Run the query ... wow how tf did i not figure out that it can take a string?!

#+name: invent-groups-eld
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent :var gql=invent-groups-graphql
(ghub-graphql gql nil
              :username "aionfork"
              :host "invent.kde.org"
              :forge 'gitlab)
#+end_src

This should be a =#+call:= or =defun= instead, but this way, I can work with eld
or json.

#+name: invent-groups-json
#+headers: :var eld=invent-groups-eld :file /tmp/invent.groups.json
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value file
(json-encode eld)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: invent-groups-json
[[file:/tmp/invent.groups.json]]

All the text is escaped or it can't be formatted.
+ as TSV: =#+begin_src jq :results output file :file /tmp/invent.groups.tsv=

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

cat the +tsv+ ... +csv+ ... TSV to a table

#+begin_src sh :results output table
